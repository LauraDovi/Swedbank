# Hint for SQL Management Studio

If you follow this tips SSMS will be your best friend ðŸ˜Š

## Save often

Save often when working with the diagram and with tables.

## Save a row

In table editor, you have to change line for the row to be added/changed.

The red circles is no big deal. It only means that the row isn't yet changed in the database.

## Esc, esc, esc

If you get stuck on a row in the table editor, press **Esc** three times.

## One tab

Get the habit of closing tabs often. You can use "Close all tabs".

Only work with one tab at a time. 

## Reopen a table

If you see a table that looks strange, close the tab and open it again. It might be outdated.

## Red squigglies

The code window in Management Studio is quite slow in realising that you have updated your database with new columns and tables.

So if you get red squiggles around keyword try refreshing the cache:

Press Ctrl-Shift-R to "Refresh Local Cache". Then "intellisence" will work better.

## Intellisence

Don't trust intellisence too much (the suggestions that appear when you type code in query-window)

## SQL-commands

If you do SELECT-statement you will always get the right data. So no worries here.

## Object explorer

The object explorer isn't always updated. Right-click on e.g "Tables" to see your newly created tables.
